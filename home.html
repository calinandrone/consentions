                    <h3>Award-Winning Food</h3>
                    <p>
                        In the tradition of Italy, our chefs make every attempt to use locally-sourced
                        meats, cheeses, and produce whenever possible, and our pastas and pizza doughts
                        are made fresh every day. This philosophy combined with our chefs' talents has
                        garnered awards from Yelp, OpenTable, and more.
